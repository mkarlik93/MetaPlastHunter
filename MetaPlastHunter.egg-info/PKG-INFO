Description: # MetaPlastHunter rc
        ## MetaPlastHunter for read classificaton
        
        
        The tool for accurate classifing and quantifing reads of plastid origin from metagenomes.
        
        MetaPlstHunter will search the provided sequences (Fastq) or sequence alignment file (SAM) and acurate classify them using MetaPlastHunter algorithm :
        
        MetaPlastHunter provides:
        
        * Searching raw reads against constantly updated and curated DB of protistan plastid genomes, quantifing and visualization using Krona tools
        * Analyzing aligned reads aligned DB in SAM format, quantifing and vizualization using Krona tools
        * Searching raw reads against DB using heuristic k - mer matching module, quantifing and vizualization using Krona tools
        
        ### Installation
        
        ##### github
